    "In this project, we scraped 11k property rent listings from domain.com.au (~6k after preprocessing) and, combined with API queried POI data, tried to answer the 3 fundamental questions. We performed statistical tests on the scraped data combined with external data such as crime rate and income to determine relevant features to be used in our model. We used POI data as an insight into what makes certain properties valuable, but they provide no predictive value since their numbers do not fluctuate much over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We fit linear models to the dataset, and used correlation metrics to determine useful features. Unfortunately, only income was found to have any correlation with rent price, which resulted in our model not being very accurate. However, the model still was able to show us a general trend for the future, which still allowed us to answer the question of predictive growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For matters of livability, we used POI data and created a metric based on external reports of what Victorians consider to be signs that a place is livable. For affordability, we used income data and rent prices in each SA2 area to obtain an estimated percentage of salary to be paid for rent. From external reports, we found that most Australians are only willing to pay up to 30% of their salary on rent, and thus we reasoned that anything below that threshold for each SA2 area is considered to be affordable."
