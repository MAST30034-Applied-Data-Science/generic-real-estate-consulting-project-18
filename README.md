This is our Final Industry Project for subject MAST30024 Applied Data Science. In this project, we aim to:
1. discover the most significant internal and external features for predicting rental prices in various SA2 suburbs within Victoria
2. find suburbs with highest predicted rental growth rate within the next three years
3. find the most liveable and affordable suburbs according to our chosen metrics

Ultimately we endeavor to provide data driven insights and guidance to real estate agencies who are looking to increase demand of their listed rental properties and maximise profit during this period of high uncertainty

In order to run the code pipeline we have developed as part of this project, please follow the below steps: 

1. Go to our data repository on google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y3k7ujNOIbSrIAlJIWHFlnuAioTxkzK_?usp=sharing, and download the POIs, raw, and 2 shapefiles (LGA and SA2 shapefiles).

2. after cloning the repository onto a local, drag the zip files into the data folder ( For the POIs files, it may be split into two when zipped, please make sure all zip files are in the folder to allow code to run smoothly)

3. set directory to notebooks folder

4. run  notebooks/run.ipynb 


run.ipynb will automatically run the following notebooks in order:
